## What are dotfiles? 
In the Unix world programs are configured either via shell arguments or plain-text files known as "dotfiles". They are called "dotfiles" because the file name begings with a dot `.` and are therefore hidden. You might find that many of the dotfiles contain an `rc` such as `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`, those are runcom files that contain an application's startup instructions.
