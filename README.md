## What are dotfiles? 
In the Unix world programs are configured either via shell arguments or plain-text files known as **"dotfiles"**. They are called "dotfiles" because the file name begings with a dot `.` and are therefore hidden. You might find that many of the dotfiles contain an `rc` such as `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`, those are runcom files that contain an application's startup instructions.

The goal of this setup is to create a minimal distraction free work environment using the least amount of hardware ressources (350 Mb memory usage at idle proves it well). **[Ricing](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/wiki/themeing/dictionary#wiki_rice)** and visual improvements are a secondary goal.
